On project:
Please take this page and copy for every single section ("Research Experience", "Work Experience", "Educational Experience", and "Extracurriculars"), and link each of the 4 pages to their respective image, so that when you click the image, you are taken to a separate webpage that corresponds with the image (such as a page on "Research" for the "Research Experience" image).
Please make sure there is at least one image on each of these portfolio pages. I can replace the images as needed later.

On all pages:
Please make sure that the code flows well and works. Otherwise, please advise.
